<h2> Chemistry: A Molecular Approach by Nivaldo J. Tro</h2>

<p><strong>This Book</strong>&nbsp;is an innovative, pedagogically driven text that explains challenging concepts in a student-oriented manner.&nbsp; <strong>Nivaldo Tro</strong> creates a rigorous and accessible treatment of general chemistry in the context of relevance and the big picture. Chemistry is presented visually through multi-level images&ndash;macroscopic, molecular, and symbolic representations&ndash;helping students see the connections between the world they see around them (macroscopic), the atoms and molecules that compose the world (molecular), and the formulas they write down on paper (symbolic). The hallmarks of <strong>Dr. Tro's problem-solving approach</strong> are reinforced through interactive media that provide students with an office-hour type of environment built around worked examples and expanded coverage on the latest developments in chemistry. Pioneering features allow students to sketch their ideas through new problems, and much more.</p>
